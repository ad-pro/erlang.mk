2018/12/03: Relx has been updated to v3.27.0.

2018/12/03: Dependencies are no longer always rebuilt by
            default. Please check the documentation for
            information. A quick fix if this causes an
            issue is to add `FULL = 1` at the top of your
            Makefile.

2018/12/06: Change the default COVER_DATA_DIR to be the
            same as COVER_REPORT_DIR.

2019/06/20: `list-deps` now includes local applications
            found in the `APPS_DIR` directory.

2020/03/25: The `-lerl_interface` argument has been removed
            from the default `LDLIBS`. This is an old library
            that is getting removed in OTP-23 and should no
            longer be used. Note that the default still includes
            `-lei` which is part of the Erlang/OTP Erl_Interface
            *application* but is built as a separate C library.
            The removal only applies to `-lerl_interface` itself.

2020/06/18: Concuerror integration has been added. It is
            currently minimal but usable. Experimentation
            and feedback is welcome.
